# UniversalDiffEq

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jarroyoe/UniversalDiffEq.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jarroyoe/UniversalDiffEq.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

UniversalDiffEq.jl is a simple-to-use front-end for the [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl) package. DiffEqFlux.jl focuses on the general implementation of [Universal Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385) (UDEs). In particular, this front-end is thought of to implement UDEs as a tool for time series analysis and forecasting.

This front-end is intended for practitioners not necesarilly proficient in Julia. If you want to go deeper into the technical details of UDEs, please use DiffEqFlux.jl instead.

UniversalDiffEq.jl is currently under development and not on the Julia registry. To install and load it, open Julia and type the following code:

```
]add https://github.com/jarroyoe/UniversalDiffEq.jl
using UniversalDiffEq
```
